Project based on the Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks paper

This project is based on [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21056.epdf?author_access_token=8oxIcYWf5UNrNpHsUHd2StRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NXpMHRAJy8Qn10ys2O4tuPakXos4UhQAFZ750CsBNMMsISFHIKinKDMKjShCpHIlYPYUHhNzkn6pSnOCt0Ftf6) paper that aims at developing an AI agent that can classify images of skin lesions either as one of the two benign types (nevi and seborrheic keratoses) or as the deadly melanoma, using deep neural networks.
